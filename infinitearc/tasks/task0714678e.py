Task ID: 0714678e
Difficulty: easy

=== Tags ===

- Pattern modification

=== Description ===
The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid by applying a
consistent algebraic operation to each cell. Each cell's value in the output
grid is determined by multiplying the corresponding input cell's value by 2 and
taking the result modulo 10. For example, a cell with value 3 becomes 6, a cell
with value 5 becomes 0, and a cell with value 9 becomes 8. This transformation
modifies the numerical pattern of the grid while adhering to a deterministic
algebraic rule, ensuring all output grids differ from their inputs (as the
generator avoids all-zero inputs, which would result in identical grids). The
operation is simple, consistent, and discoverable through examination of small
input-output pairs.
