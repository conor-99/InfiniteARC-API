"""
Task ID: eb36e976
Difficulty: easy

=== Tags ===
- Image repetition
- Pattern deconstruction

=== Description ===
The input grid contains a horizontally repeating pattern in each row, where each
row consists of two identical segments. For example, a row such as [1, 2, 3, 1,
2, 3] contains the pattern [1, 2, 3] repeated twice. The output grid is formed
by taking only the first segment of each row, effectively halving the width of
the input grid while preserving its height. This transformation deconstructs the
repeated pattern into its base form, resulting in a grid where each row contains
exactly one instance of the repeating pattern. The output grid is visually
distinct from the input, as it removes the redundant repetition, making the core
pattern immediately apparent.
