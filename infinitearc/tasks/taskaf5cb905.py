"""
Task ID: af5cb905
Difficulty: easy

=== Tags ===
- Associate colors to colors

=== Description ===
The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid by applying a
consistent color substitution rule. Each color value (0-9) in the input grid is
replaced with a specific target color value according to a fixed mapping that
remains constant across all grids in the task. The mapping is a one-to-one
correspondence between input and output colors, with no overlap or identity
mappings (i.e., no color maps to itself). The input and output grids maintain
identical dimensions and structural patterns, with only the color values
changing. For example, if color 1 maps to color 5 and color 2 maps to color 7 in
the training examples, all instances of 1 in any input grid will become 5 in the
corresponding output, and all 2s will become 7s. The solver must deduce this
substitution pattern from examining the provided input-output pairs, which
contain only a small subset of the 10 possible colors to ensure clarity and
simplicity.
