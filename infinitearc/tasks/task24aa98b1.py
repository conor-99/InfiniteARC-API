- Circuit reflection

=== Description ===
The input grids depict intricate, asymmetric electrical circuits composed of
interconnected colored wire segments (horizontal or vertical paths of uniform
color) and colored junction nodes (points where wires intersect or branch). The
circuits are designed without vertical symmetry, featuring complex branching
patterns, multiple wire crossings, and varied colors that distinguish different
circuit paths. The background color is uniform and distinct from all circuit
elements.  The output grid is the exact left-right reflection of the input grid,
where every circuit element (wire segment, junction node, and background pixel)
is mirrored across the vertical midline. This means the leftmost column of the
input becomes the rightmost column of the output, and vice versa, while
preserving all colors and structural relationships. Wire segments maintain their
continuity after reflection (e.g., a horizontal wire segment at the top-left
reflects to the top-right), and junction nodes align precisely with their
mirrored counterparts. Background pixels retain their original color and
position relative to the reflected circuit. The reflection is applied uniformly
across the entire grid, with no additional elements added, removed, or altered
beyond the horizontal mirroring. The task requires precise visual mapping of the
circuit's structure to its mirrored counterpart, demanding attention to detail
across complex, multi-layered wire patterns.
