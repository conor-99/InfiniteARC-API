- Extrapolate image from grid

=== Description ===
The input grid contains a small image represented by a 2D grid of colors. The
output grid is created by uniformly scaling the input image by a factor of 2,
where each pixel in the input is replaced with a 2x2 block of identical color in
the output. For example, a single colored cell in the input becomes a 2x2 square
of that color in the output, and the entire image expands proportionally. This
transformation is consistent across all cells, resulting in an output grid that
is exactly twice as wide and twice as tall as the input, with no additional
elements or modifications beyond the scaling.
