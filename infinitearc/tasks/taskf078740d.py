Task ID: f078740d
Difficulty: easy

=== Tags ===
- Associate images to images
- Take maximum
- Pattern intersection
- Expand to square canvas

=== Description ===
The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid by expanding it
to the smallest possible square canvas while preserving the original pattern.
The input grid will always have non-square dimensions (e.g., 3×5 or 5×3),
ensuring the output differs from the input. The transformation rule is as
follows: the output grid is a square with side length equal to the maximum of
the input's width and height. The original input pattern is placed in the top-
left corner of the output grid, and all remaining cells are filled with a fixed
background color (black, represented as 0). This process inherently associates
the input image to its square-canvas counterpart, takes the maximum dimension to
determine the square size, and ensures the pattern fits within the new canvas
through simple padding. The visual nature of the task relies entirely on spatial
arrangement and geometric expansion, avoiding numerical or value-based
reasoning.
