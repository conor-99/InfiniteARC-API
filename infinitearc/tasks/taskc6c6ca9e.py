Task ID: c6c6ca9e
Difficulty: easy

=== Tags ===
- Out of boundary
- Summarize
- Size guessing

=== Description ===
The task involves transforming input grids that feature a consistent border of
zeros (color 0) surrounding a non-zero inner region. The output grid is formed
by removing this outer border of zeros, resulting in a smaller grid that
contains only the inner non-zero content. The size of the output grid is
determined by subtracting 2 from both the width and height of the input grid
(e.g., a 5×5 input becomes a 3×3 output). The solver must recognize the border
of zeros as "out of boundary" elements, "summarize" the input by focusing on the
core content, and "guess" the output size by deducing the reduction from the
input dimensions. This transformation is deterministic, requires no
memorization, and is discoverable through simple observation of the grid
structure.
