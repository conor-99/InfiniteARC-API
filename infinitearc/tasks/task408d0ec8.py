"""
Task ID: 408d0ec8
Difficulty: easy

=== Tags ===
- Remove border
- Even or odd
- Extrapolate image from grid

=== Description ===
The task involves transforming an input grid by first removing its outermost
border (all pixels in the first and last rows and columns), resulting in an
inner grid. The inner grid is then processed such that each remaining pixel
value is replaced with 0 if the original value was even, or 1 if the original
value was odd. This transformation uses the "Remove border" rule to isolate the
inner grid, applies the "Even or odd" rule to modify pixel values based on
parity, and produces a new grid ("Extrapolate image from grid") that represents
a simplified, parity-based version of the inner content. For example, a 3×3
input grid's center pixel (after border removal) becomes 0 or 1 depending on
whether its original value was even or odd.
