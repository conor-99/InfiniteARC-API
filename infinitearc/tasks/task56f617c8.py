Task ID: 56f617c8
Difficulty: easy

=== Tags ===
- Color permutation
- Copy paste patch

=== Description ===
The task involves transforming a grid by performing a specific color
permutation. The input grid is a 2D array of integers between 0 and 9,
representing distinct colors. The transformation rule swaps all instances of
color 1 with color 2 and all instances of color 2 with color 1 throughout the
grid. All other colors remain unchanged. For example, if a cell contains 1 in
the input, it becomes 2 in the output, and vice versa. This rule is consistent
and deterministic, requiring no complex reasoning beyond identifying the two
colors to swap. The "copy paste patch" tag refers to the visual effect of the
swapped colors appearing as if the color patterns were copied and pasted between
their positions. The input grid must contain at least one instance of both color
1 and color 2 to ensure the output differs from the input, which is guaranteed
by the generator.
