"""
Task ID: 25ebde60
Difficulty: easy

=== Tags ===
- Swap columns
- Count patterns
- Pattern juxtaposition
- Pattern reflection

=== Description ===
The task involves reflecting the input grid horizontally. Each row in the output
grid is the reverse of the corresponding row in the input grid. For example, the
first column of the input becomes the last column of the output, the second
column becomes the second-to-last, and so on. This transformation is applied
uniformly across all rows, resulting in a mirror image of the input grid along
the vertical axis. The reflection is determined by the inherent symmetry of the
grid's patterns, where patterns in the input are juxtaposed with their mirrored
counterparts in the output, creating a consistent reflection effect. The count
of patterns within the grid does not alter the reflection rule but confirms the
consistency of the mirrored structure.
